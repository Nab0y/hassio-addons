## ⚠️ Important Notice

**ATTENTION!** This add-on was created through vibe coding with LLM assistance. I'm not particularly strong in Python programming, so please don't be too harsh if something goes wrong. 

🤖 **AI-Assisted Development**: These add-ons are the result of collaborative work between human creativity and AI assistance. While functional and tested, they may not follow all best practices that a seasoned developer would implement.

🐛 **Bug Reports Welcome**: If you encounter issues, please report them! It's a learning experience for both the code and the developer.
